# ðŸ§  Task 7.2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository contains my implementation of Task 7.2 from the ARCH TECHNOLOGIES INTERNSHIP Program. The task is based on Chapters 1 and 2 of the book **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

- **Chapter 1:** Covers basic ML concepts, types of learning, key challenges, and model selection strategies.
- **Chapter 2:** Demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning project using the California Housing dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- `Task_7.2_Report_SanaMehdi_Final.docx`: Full report with code explanations and theory tasks
- `notebook.ipynb` or `main.py`: Python notebook or script implementing the project pipeline
- `housing_hist.png`: Visual of feature distributions
- `README.md`: This file

## ðŸš€ ML Pipeline Steps

1. Download and extract the dataset
2. Perform data exploration and visualization
3. Stratified train-test split using income category
4. Data preprocessing using Pipelines and ColumnTransformer
5. Train multiple models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
6. Evaluate models using cross-validation and RMSE
7. Fine-tune with GridSearchCV
